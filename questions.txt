1) What is the general trend in the curve?
  It is upward! The more training data you give it, the more accurate it becomes.
2) Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
  The beginning of the graph looks a bit rougher than the middle and end (starting
  from about 50% of the data on). I assume this is because after this point there
  is more training data than testing data and you're more likely to get an accurate
  result.
3) How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
  I don't think we can get a smoother curve with more trials. We're up to 100 trials
  in increments of 1 now and it's still very jagged.
4) Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10** -10)). What happens?
If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation
for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
  Um. So changing the C made it 60% accurate at 12ish percent training data
  before it spikes down to 10 perfect accurate. When I made C larger the curve
  became less jagged but still very bumpy. Reading about Tikhonov regularization
  didn't really make it clearer for me.
